[!Mudebz](https://lottery-hazel.vercel.app) is a decentralized web application that provides a convenient interface for interacting with a smart contract deployed on the blockchain, which includes:
1. Lottery.
2. NFT collection.
3. Lobby for P2P games.
4. Own token MUD.

The creator does not position this project as a business trying to earn the most money. All functions that this smart contract contains do not have any commissions.

!Mudebz was created to provide users with a transparent and independent platform to increase their capital.

All the successes and failures of the players on this platform are due to the theory of probability and cannot be adjusted by third parties in any way.

For a complete overview of the project, you can refer to this GitHub repository and to the smart contract pages in the block explorer on the [Ethereum mainnet](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x257bd405d6f00668655979870cb82a3ba9e91a6f) (Goerli testnet during the beta test) and [Binance Smart Chain](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x257bd405d6f00668655979870cb82a3ba9e91a6f) (Sepolia testnet during the beta test).
***
### 1. Lottery
Deposit: from lottery 1 to 1050 - 5 USDT, from lottery 1051 - 10 MUD

Once a day for 1000 days starting from TBD(date) at 23:59 Moscow time (+03:00 from UTC) will be drawn: all tokens collected during the day and the opportunity to purchase NFT dedicated to this lottery.
***
### 2. Lobby
This is a kind of game of heads and tails on the blockchain with a wide range of customization options.

Any user can create a lobby by specifying:
1. ERC-20 token 
2. A deposit greater than zero (it is necessary to have the specified number of tokens on the internal wallet of the smart contract, since the creator automatically takes part in the lobby created by him)
3. The number of players in the range from 2 to 1000 people.

Once a lobby has been created, it cannot be canceled by anyone.

As soon as the required number of participants is reached, the lobby will be drawn, and the winner will receive all the collected tokens of this lobby.

Each wallet can have a maximum of 10 active lobbies created by it.
You can participate in unlimited numbers.
***
### 3. NFT collection
The collection contains about 5% of unique NFTs that are somehow related to the date of their lottery (not available in beta).

The entire collection can be viewed on the !MuDeBz website in the [Gallery](https://lottery-hazel.vercel.app/Galary) tab
(this is not the final version of the collection, it will be further developed).

The collection contains 1000 NFTs.

Only winners of the first 1000 lotteries are allowed to mint (the original creation of nft), and they can only mint the NFT whose serial number matches the number of the lottery they won.

The winner of the lottery is given 50 days to purchase NFT, if NFT is not created after the specified time, then the winner will lose his advantage by a minute.

The price of a mint is 0.08 ETH. (Creating an NFT is not required to receive a lottery win, but it is required for the subsequent airdrop of MUD tokens).
***
### 4. MUD tokens
Airdrop of tokens will take place at the moment of drawing 1050 lottery.

Token emission - 1.000.000.000 on each blockchain.

All possible options for obtaining MUD:
1. Be the owner of the NFT at the time of the airdrop (Owners will share 8% of the total emission of the token).
2. Be an NFT owner ever (users who have ever owned an NFT will share 17% of the entire supply of the token, these are only unique wallets that participated in the first 100 movements of any NFT on the blockchain. The maximum number of applicants for data is 17% - 1000 NFTs * 100 transfers = 100,000 wallets).
3. Participation in the referral program.
4. Participation from 1051 to 2050 lottery.
5. Participation in the lobby, starting from the 1051 lottery.
In the future, a bridge between blockchains will be added and the tokens will be fungible.
***
### 5. Referral program
A user who has never participated in a lottery before can enter someone else's promo code, and after he enters his first lottery, the creator of the promo code and this user will increase their airdrop by 1000 MUD.

It will be possible to receive MUD to your wallet only after 1050 lottery.

You can create and enter a promo code only once (you can enter someone else's promo code only before the first participation in the lottery).
 ***
### 6. 1051 - 2050 lotteries
1. Lottery
Starting from lottery 1050, the token for the game will change from USDT to MUD.
Now, after the drawing, all lottery participants will share 100,000 MUD tokens among themselves (The winner will still take all the collected tokens)
2. Lobby
From lottery 1050, each lobby, whose token is MUD and the deposit is more than 50, will distribute 10 MUD to all participants. Every day, from 1050 lottery, the basket from which these coins will be taken will be replenished with 300.000 MUD.
***
### 7. Mistery
The Creator has come up with a Mistery. The user who guesses it will receive 1% of the entire emission of the MUD token.
Look for the field for entering your solution to the mistery on the !MuDeBz website.
There is a cooldown of one hour between each puzzle attempt.
